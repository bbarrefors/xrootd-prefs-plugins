Xrootd_prefs_plugin

DESCRIPTION
The XROOTD project aims at gicing high performance, scalable foult tolerant access to data repositories of many kinds. The data is spread out on many servers around the world and kept track of by redirect servers. When a file is queried by a client the redirect server asks the servers under it which ones can provide this file, after responses come back the redirector selects a server in a round robin selection process and passes this information on to the client which then queries the data directly from the server. This project aims at improving the selection process done by the redirector server. The main goal is to select the server which can provide the file to the client fastest. This plugin use geographical position as the measurement for how well suited a server is. The assumption is that the closer the server is to the client the faster it can provide the file.

GOAL
Decrease data transfer from server to client

TOOLS
